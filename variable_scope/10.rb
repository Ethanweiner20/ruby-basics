The code will raise an error.

When `my_value` is invoked, it tries to access a local variable `a` in the `each` block, but `a` is never initialized in the `my_value method`. Since methods have self-contained scope, they do not have access to outer variables. While the each block does have access to local variables in the outer scope, that outer scope is the scope of `my_value`, which does not have access to `a`. So the block also does not have access to `a`.
